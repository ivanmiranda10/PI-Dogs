            This project was made by Ivan Miranda with the purpose of assimilate
            all the modules seen across the Henry's bootcamp. <br />
            With the knowledge acquired, i was able to build and connect the
            Data Base (PostgresSQL - Sequelize), Backend (Node - Express) and
            Frontend (React - Redux) of the present application. <br />
